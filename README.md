# fileGPT
Add GPT to files



For me, a text editor is more convenient than a web-based solution. Here is a Python script that adds GPT to your text editor (preferably VS Code).

By writing "pl" in a text editor and saving the file, it will prompt GPT and add generated text. The program is written in Python. Just remember to change the API key.

Execute the script by writing "python3 main.py text.txt" when you want to use the LLM. To generate a response, write "pl" at the end of the file and save it. Then it will generate a response. Enjoy!
